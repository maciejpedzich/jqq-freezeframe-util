# jqq-freezeframe-util

Utility for grabbing random frames from James Q Quick's videos. It's far from perfect, but it should work (most of the time).

## Setup

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/maciejpedzich/jqq-freezeframe-util.git
```

Now `cd` into project's directory, and run `node index.js`;
